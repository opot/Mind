NoName game!

Now it still in alpha and it has few content, but I can simly add new content. The main idea is round world and now you can go throught it and craft items to kill mobs!
Yout can see some screenshot in twitter and compile game using sources from github!

Game Controls:
Arrows to move your character(or chhow corrrect option in menu)
"Enter" to choose object in menu
"Space" to use Current item
"I" to open craft menu
"M" to open map
"F3" to see debug info

Craft recipes
-2*wood = boomerang
-2*wood+stone = axe
-rainbow egg = rainbow dust
-blackhole stone = blackhole dust
-blackhole dust + rainbow duat = dynamite
-4*stone = stone wall
(to craft use stone button under craft fileld(on left side))

Sorry for my English.
